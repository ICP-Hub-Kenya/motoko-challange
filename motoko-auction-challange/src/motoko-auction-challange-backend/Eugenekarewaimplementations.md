# Implementations Documented by Eugenekarewa

## Overview
This document outlines the implementations made to the decentralized auction system in the Motoko programming language.

## Implementations

1. **Auction Data Structure**:
   - Implemented the `Auction` type to store auction details, including item information, bid history, remaining time, reserve price, and auction status.

2. **Stable Variables**:
   - Used stable variables to ensure auction data persists across canister upgrades. The `auctions` variable stores all active auctions.

3. **Creating Auctions**:
   - Implemented the `newAuction` function to create a new auction with a specified item, duration, and reserve price.

4. **Retrieving Auction Details**:
   - Created the `getAuctionDetails` function to retrieve detailed information about a specific auction.

5. **Active Auctions Retrieval**:
   - Implemented the `getActiveAuctions` function to return a list of all active auctions.

6. **Bidding Functionality**:
   - Implemented the `makeBid` function to allow users to place bids on auctions, ensuring that bids are higher than the current highest bid.

7. **Closing Auctions**:
   - Implemented the `checkAndCloseAuctions` function to automatically close auctions when their remaining time reaches zero, determining the winning bid and checking against the reserve price.

8. **User Bidding History**:
   - Created the `getUserBidHistory` function to allow users to retrieve their bidding history across all auctions.

9. **Periodic Timer**:
   - Implemented the `heartbeat` function to decrement the remaining time for active auctions and check for auctions that need to be closed.

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding more robust error handling and edge case management.
- Implement unit tests for all functions to ensure reliability and correctness.
